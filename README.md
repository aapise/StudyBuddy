# StudyBuddy

“StudyBuddy” is a web application designed to facilitate collaborative reading in the group
study environment. The application incorporates functionalities to allow users to form study
groups and perform reading activities in a coordinated manner. Multiple users can read a
document simultaneously, adding annotations to the document as and when they are
reading it. They can also choose to view annotations added by other group members and
get updates about the same in real time.

A digital prototype was created in order to carry out usability testing for the application. You can view the prototype demo [here](https://youtu.be/JLy0BOBPbq0).

A design specification and usability evaluation report was created. You can view the report [here]().

This project developed for the Human Computer Interaction course at NC State.
